## nodejs-reverse-proxy
This is just a simple reverse proxy that can be used to easily expose local server to the internet with tunneling.
This allows you to use your own domain for the site easily and the tunnle link can be updated easily.

Use a `.env` file on the root of this project and have `SERVER` property with your server/tunneling link as value.
